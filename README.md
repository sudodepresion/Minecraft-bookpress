# Minecraft-bookpress
### Helps you import large texts into Minecraft book


## Requirements
You need to have python as well as pip installed. Furthermore this was only testet on 2 Windows 11 PCs beacause thats all I have, so if you ar e experiencing issues with it on a different OS, inform me about it.

## The files
There is a .exe and a zip folder. The zip folder is a c# form(not with the .net framework) Project you can check/compile yourself if you dont trust the .exe.
(Rather be safe than sorry, dont just take my word for it)

## What does it do? 
If you start it for the first time it will execute a cmd command downloading the pynput library(You can see this in the Form1.cs File on line 31-40.
Then It will open the main window.

### How to use the main window
