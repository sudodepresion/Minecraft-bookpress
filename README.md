# Minecraft-bookpress
### Helps you import large texts into Minecraft book


## Requirements
You need to have python as well as pip installed. Furthermore this was only testet on 2 Windows 11 PCs beacause thats all I have, so if you ar e experiencing issues with it on a different OS, inform me about it.

## The files
There is a .exe and a zip folder. The zip folder is a c# form(not with the .net framework) Project you can check/compile yourself if you dont trust the .exe.
(Rather be safe than sorry, dont just take my word for it)

## What does it do? 
If you start it for the first time it will execute a cmd command downloading the pynput library(You can see this in the Form1.cs File on line 31-40.
Then It will open the main window.

## How to use the main window
When you start the programm you will see this window.

If you make it as small as possible, you could fit as many charackters(with max size, not every charackter takes up the same amount of space)
as a page in the book would have.

Before you press run, you should calibrate it. To do this press on the button and hover your mouse over the next page arrow(In minecraft)

Then you can just paste your text into the field and press run. You will have 2 seconds to press on the minecraft screen again,
because it has to be your active window.
